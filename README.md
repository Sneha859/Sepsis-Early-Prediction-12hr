# 🩺 Sepsis Early Prediction (12 Hours Ahead)

This project presents a machine learning–based system to predict the early onset of sepsis **12 hours in advance** using patient vital signs and laboratory parameters. The trained model is deployed through a Streamlit web application to support real-time clinical risk assessment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition caused by the body’s extreme response to infection. Delayed diagnosis can result in organ failure and increased mortality. Traditional rule-based systems often detect sepsis late. This project aims to provide **early and accurate prediction** using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
- Machine learning–based early sepsis prediction
- Random Forest classifier for robust performance
- Handles class imbalance using SMOTE
- Pipeline-based preprocessing (scaling + model)
- Interactive Streamlit web application

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
3. Class imbalance handling with SMOTE  
4. Model training using Random Forest  
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, AUC)  
6. Deployment using Streamlit
